### About
This repository is a compilation of various C# solutions, ranging from simple console applications to more complex ASP.NET Core web programs. Each project resides in its own folder and is ready to be opened and run in your C# Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Projects Included
The projects below demonstrate key concepts in C# development, data access, and web application architecture:

* Student App: Console app focusing on EF Core basics.

* Newsletter MVC App: Simple web forms built with the Model-View-Controller pattern.

* Premier League Stats: Data modeling and tracking for sports statistics.

* Car Insurance: A comprehensive business application demo.

And more!

### Project Details
Student App (EF Core Code-First Console Application)
This project demonstrates the Code-First approach using Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with a simple SQLite database. The application defines the data model in C# (Student class), and EF Core handles the creation and management of the database schema.

### Goals
* Define a Student model and a SchoolContext.

* Connect to a lightweight SQLite database.

* Automatically create the database and table upon first run.

* Implement basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations.

Newsletter MVC Application
This project provides the foundation for a simple web application designed to capture user email subscriptions, built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in ASP.NET Core.

### Core Technology
### Architecture: ASP.NET Core MVC

* Data: EF Core with SQL Server (a standard choice for MVC).

### Goals
* Create a responsive web application using the MVC structure.

* Implement a simple model (Subscriber) to store user emails.

* Set up EF Core for data persistence.

* Create views for displaying the subscription form and a confirmation page.

### Premier League Fantasy Tracker
An application designed to leverage the power of Entity Framework Core to manage and track fantasy league statistics for Premier League players, utilizing seeded data for realistic context.

### Key Features
* Player Statistics Hub: View detailed, up-to-date stats (goals, assists, points) for all tracked players, leveraging pre-seeded data.

* Team Management: Features to create and manage user-defined fantasy squads.

* Points Calculation: Automated calculation of weekly fantasy scores based on player performance metrics.

* League View: Ability to see rankings and performance of all teams within a custom league.

### Car Insurance Management System
A robust application designed to streamline the car insurance process, from generating quotes to managing existing policies and processing claims.

### Key Features
* Quote Generation: Calculate personalized insurance premiums based on driver profile and vehicle data.

* Policy Management: Store and retrieve policy details, status, and renewal dates efficiently.

* Secure Authentication: Implement role-based access for Agents, Customers, and Administrators.

* Claims Tracking: A dedicated module for submitting, tracking, and reviewing insurance claims.

* Document Storage: Ability to upload and manage policy-related documents.

### Getting Started
To get started with any of these projects:

* Clone the repository:

* git clone [https://github.com/Jolaboy/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.git](https://github.com/Jolaboy/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.git)

### Navigate to a project folder:

* cd Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/<ProjectName>

* Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or VS Code with C# Dev Kit).

* Run the solution!

Note: For projects using Entity Framework Core (like StudentApp), the database file will be created automatically when the application runs for the first time.

### How to Contribute
